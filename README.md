# 🎤 Transformer-based Speech Anonymization

This project implements a **Transformer-based neural architecture** for **speech anonymization**, where the model transforms an input Mel-Spectrogram into a modified version that conceals speaker identity while preserving linguistic content.

> ⚡ Goal: Protect speaker privacy while retaining the semantic integrity of speech.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Mel-Spectrogram Preprocessing** with `librosa`
- ✅ **Custom Positional Encoding Layer** for time-frequency data
- ✅ **Multi-Head Attention Blocks** inspired by Transformer architecture
- ✅ **Custom Loss Function** balancing content preservation and anonymization
- ✅ **Modular and Scalable Design** for easy experimentation and extension

## 🧠 Model Architecture

This project adapts the Transformer encoder design for 2D Mel-Spectrogram inputs:

- **Input:** `(T, M)` Mel-Spectrogram (Time × Mel-bins)
- **Layers:**
  - Positional Encoding
  - Stack of N Transformer encoder blocks:
    - Layer Normalization
    - Multi-Head Self-Attention
    - Feed-Forward Network
    - Residual Connections
- **Output:** Transformed Mel-Spectrogram with anonymized speaker characteristics

---

## 🧪 Custom Loss Function

```python
total_loss = α * ContentLoss + (1 - α) * AnonymizationLoss
```

- **Content Loss**: Encourages preserving the original content
- **Anonymization Loss**: Encourages dissimilarity in speaker identity features

This design supports tunable privacy-preservation tradeoffs via the `α` hyperparameter.

## 📊 Example Usage

```python
# Load and convert audio to Mel-spectrogram
mel = preprocess_audio("sample.wav")

# Predict anonymized version
output = transformer_model.predict(mel[np.newaxis, ...])
```

## 🛠️ Training

To train on dummy data (replace with real samples):

```python
transformer_model.fit(dummy_data, dummy_labels, batch_size=16, epochs=10)
```

---

## 🧰 Dependencies

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Core libraries:**
- TensorFlow
- librosa
- NumPy

---

## 🎯 Applications

- Privacy-preserving voice assistants
- Anonymous call centers
- Speech data sharing with built-in de-identification
- Preprocessing for training fairer speech recognition models

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Integrate speaker verification metrics to quantify anonymization
- Add evaluation with WER (Word Error Rate) to measure content preservation
- Support real-time inference using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX
